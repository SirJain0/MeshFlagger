# Mesh Flagger
<p>Flags meshes in a project on demand.</p>

## Worth Noting:
- Plugin has the following capabilities: Flags all meshes in a project, and flags all meshes with six faces in a project.
- The desired effect of the six-faced functionality is to flag meshes that may look like cuboids but really are, internally, meshes. However, that's not always going to be the case.
- If you are wondering why a particular 6-faced mesh isn't being flagged, make sure the mesh doesn't have any loop cuts.
## How to use:

Go to <b>Tools > Flag Meshes</b> and simply select one of the options - <b>Flag All Meshes</b> for all meshes and <b>Flag 6-Faced Meshes</b> for meshes with 6 faces.
